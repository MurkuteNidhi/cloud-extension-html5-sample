# Setup of a SAP Business Technology Platform subccount using Boosters
## Introduction

**Abbreviation:** SAP Business Technology Platform = SAP BTP

For running the HTML5 mission you will need the following services in your SAP BTP account:

* SAP Business Application Studio
* SAP Launchpad or optional SAP Cloud Portal service  
* SAP HTML5 Application (kernel service - no quota necessary)
* SAP Continuous Integration & Delivery Service (optional)

The entitlement differs for the pricing option of your account:

**Consumption-based SAP BTP Account:** 
No entitlement necessary. Be sure that you have enough credits to run the services.

**Subscription-based SAP BTP Account:** 
You have to create entitlements for the services above - [see also Entitlements and Quotas](https://help.sap.com/viewer/df50977d8bfa4c9a8a063ddb37113c43/Cloud/en-US/38ecf59cdda64150a102cfaa62d5faab.html#loio363f0f68f9704830ac65c87a2562559b).

**Booster:**

The setup could be done for each service individually. To simplify the setup process, SAP has introduced Boosters. Boosters are a collection of wizards that provides functionalities for specific scenarios to automate and speed-up the installation and configuration process of a SAP BTP subaccount. This also includes the user management with the mapping of the respective administrator and developer roles.

Before running the booster please check for which regions and infrastructures the services are available - [see SAP BTP Regions and Service Portfolio ](https://help.sap.com/doc/aa1ccd10da6c4337aa737df2ead1855b/Cloud/en-US/3b642f68227b4b1398d2ce1a5351389a.html) - unfortunately the booster is not able to check this in advance, so it will fail when you select a region where a service is not available.



**Persona:** Cloud Administrator



## Step-by-step

### A: Run the Booster

1. Start the Booster
   1. Login to your global SAP BTP account.
   2. Select Boosters in the account menu.
   2. Select the Booster **Prepare an account for HTML5 application development**
   
   ![Start Booster](./images/booster1.png)


2.  Booster Overview
   
    ![Booster Overview](./images/booster2.png)

3.  Choose the **Components** tab and review the Components that will be installed with the Booster - choose **Start**
    
    ![Booster Overview](./images/booster33.png)
 
4.  Check Prerequisites - the Booster checks if you have all the entitlements that are needed to run it. There is only a check for mandatory components. As the **Continous Integration & Delivery service** is optional, the Booster will not check for it. If you want to use it, be sure that you have an Entitlement for this service.
   
    ![Check Prerequisites](./images/booster4.png)
 
5.  Setup Subaccount and check/assign Entitlements: 
    Here you set the necessary quota for running HTML5 applications on your subaccount.
    For running this mission, below mentioned quota of the services are the minimum requirements, for building additional applications in your subaccount you have to increase the quota accordingly.

    If you do not entitlement for the Continous Integration & Delivery service it will not appear in the list. For accounts with the consumption-based model you can delete it, if you don't want to use it as it is an optional service.

    For the runtime of the HTML5 application you can either use the Portal and Launchpad service - so only one of them is needed. In this mission we use the Launchpad service as we don't need the additional functionalities of the SAP Portal service. Therefore we remove the Portal service but you could also keep it and remove the Launchpad instead - don't keep both.

6.  Setup Subaccount credentials

    4.  Set the subaccount ID - you can keep the default
    5.  Set the subaccount org name - change it to a meaningful name
    6.  Set a space name - that's the space we will use for our mission project. In general it's recommended to have one space per project. You can later add further spaces for additional projects manually. 
    7.  Press next

### B: Check Subaccount
In your new subaccount check the following

2. Security - Open the Security section and select Administrators. Again you should see the adminstrator users assigned with the "User & Role Administrator" role. 

     ![Check account](./images/check-booster4.png)

3. Security - Select "Role Collection" in the Security section. You can see all the role collections for the different services that are created by the Booster. There are two specific collection called **Extension_UX_Administrator** and **Extension_UX_Developer** . Those are the master collections either for Administrators or Developers and contains all the necessary roles which are needed to access the services to build and deploy a HTML5 extension application. If you want to add additional users later, you have to assign those role collection to them. Click on the role *Extension_UX_Administrator*.
   
     ![Check account](./images/check-booster2.png)

4. You can check that all necessary roles already assigned for the Administrator users to access *Business Application Studio*, *Launchpad* and *Continous Integration & Delivery service*. 

     ![Check account](./images/adminRole.png)
     
5. Now click on *Extension_UX_Deverloper* in the previous acreen to see the assigned roles for developer. If you have addtional developers later, then add the developers in this screen by clicking the 'Edit' button and selecting the 'Identity Provider'.

6. Go back to the Overview of your BTP subaccount.

7. Click **Services** and then choose **Instances and Subscriptions**. Select the tab **Subscriptions**, You should see that the following services have been subscribed:
