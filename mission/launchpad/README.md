### Expose HTML5 Applications in Launchpad

In order that your HTML5 applications are visible to the Launchpad application, you have to currently add some information to the manifest.json file manually. The HTML5 applications you want to expose must be deployed to the same subaccount as the Launchpad. For more information, check [Expose HTML5 Applications in Launchpad](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ad4b9f0b14b0458cad9bd27bf435637d/Cloud/en-US/3a0e6d6b791c4c2189f6a0a424188362.html).


1. Switch to the browser window with **Business Application Studio** and open the Workspace containing your HTML5 project.
2. Expand your HTML5 project and open the manifest.json file which is under the folder BP -> webapp -> manifest.json 
3. Open the manifest.json and add the following source code inside the **sap.app** section. Do not forget to add a **,** to this **sap.app** section before you add the code below.

   ```
   "crossNavigation": {
            "inbounds": {
                "intent1": {
                    "signature": {
                        "parameters": {},
                        "additionalParameters": "allowed"
                    },
                    "semanticObject": "BusinessPartners",
                    "action": "display",
                    "title": "BusinessPartners",
                    "info": "List of BusinessPartners",
                    "icon": "sap-icon://BusinessSuiteInAppSymbols/icon-business-partner"
                }
