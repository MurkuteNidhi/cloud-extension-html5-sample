# Prerequisites: Learn about the Free Tier model

This mission can be done with an SAP Business Technology Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) or Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement (CPEA) account with free tier options. Free tier is not a distinct account, but a set of entitlement plans within a consumption-based (PAYG/CPEA) global account for activating certain services for free.

Note: **"free tier" only applies to services in SAP Business Technology Platform!**

This mission requires following SAP solution where costs may occur:
SAP S/4HANA system, optionally you can install a trial SAP Cloud Appliance Library system (see next card). For accessing the SAP S/4HANA system, you have to install the [SAP Frontend GUI](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/ATopics/SAP+GUI+Family#section5).

A Linux or Windows system for installing the Cloud Connector - it is also installed in the CAL system.

**Get Started with Free Tier**

As an SAP user with an existing CPEA or PAYG for SAP BTP contract, you can simply [log into your SAP BTP cockpit](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome) to get started.

If you don’t have a global account in SAP BTP and want to get started using the free tier, sign up for a PAYG account on the [SAP Store](https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-9999951781_live_v1/SAP%20Business%20Technology%20Platform). Once your account in provisioned, you can log in to the SAP BTP cockpit and start using the services that have the Free service plan!

>**Caution:** Unfortunately, Free Tier is currently not available for EU10. Please select any other region.

**SAP Business Technology Platform Trial**

You can also use a trial account in SAP BTP in this mission, another offering by SAP to test SAP BTP capabilities for free. The trial account is an isolated global account in SAP BTP. The subaccounts that you create come with pre-allocated service entitlements. After your trial account has been deleted, either on purpose or automatically, if you don’t use it for 365 days, all data and artifacts are deleted permanently.

To create and set up a trial account, see the [Get a Free Account on SAP BTP Trial tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) in the Tutorial Navigator.
