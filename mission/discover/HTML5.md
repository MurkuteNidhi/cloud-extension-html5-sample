# Learn about HTML5 Applications

SAP BTP enables you to access and run HTML5 applications in a cloud environment without the need to maintain your own runtime infrastructure.

HTML5 applications consist of static content that runs on a browser. You develop your HTML5 applications, either in SAP Business Application Studio, or in your own IDE (integrated development environment), and deploy them to the HTML5 Application Repository.
