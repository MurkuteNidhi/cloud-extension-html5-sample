# Configuring Custom Identity Provider

## Introduction

In this section, we would configure a custom Identity Provider which has the users/employees to login to the SAP Business Technology Platform subaccount.
Depending on your global account, you might see the default identity provider, which is configured automatically. This cannot be deleted, it can only be enabled or disabled. 

**Persona:** Cloud Administrator

**Abbreviation:** SAP Business Technology Platform = SAP BTP


## Step-by-Step

Use your SAP Identity Authentication service tenant as an identity provider or a proxy to your own identity provider hosting your business users. This method avoids the upload and download of SAML meta data by using Open ID Connect (OIDC) to establish trust.

### Register SAP BTP subaccount in the Custom Identity Provider

You can manage trust configurations for a global account only if you have created the global account or if you are an SCP Administrator of the account and you are an Administrator in your company's Identity and Authentication Tenant(SAP IAS).

Establishing the trust between your company's IDP could be done in an automatic way.
1. In the  SAP BTP cockpit of your subaccount select Security - Trust Configuration 
2. Click on **Establish Trust**

4. In the popup select your Identity provider.

   ***!Hint:** If your Identity provider is not visible then the SAP BTP account and the IDP have been created with different Customer IDs - in that case please follow the steps for the manual setup with SAML 2.0: [Link to Manual Setup Guide](./README.md).*

5. Click on Establish Trust
