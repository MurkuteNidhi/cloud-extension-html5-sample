# Developing a Cloud Application

## Introduction

SAP Business Application Studio comes out of the box with predefined set of development environments â€“ Dev-Spaces (virtual machine on the cloud where you can develop, build, test and run using pre-installed runtimes and tools) tailored for developing SAP business scenarios.

Create a simple UI extension application in SAP Business Application Studio using existing project templates in order to consume the Business Partner OData service. This application will run as a stand-alone application without a SAP Lauchpad.

### Optional Step: Adding Internationalization to your project

1. If you want your generated project to have meaningful titles and column names, you can change the default i18n file to any language file you want.
2. In the opened workspace with your project, navigate to project folder **webapp**, then to folder **i18n** and open the file i18n.properties.
3. As a sample content, we have provided you a sample i18n.properties in [Sample i18n](./images/i18n.properties).
4. Replace the contents of the i18n file with our sample content.
5. You will see the customized column headers once we test the application in the next step. 

### Result
You have now configured a development workspace and created a HTML5 Application successfully. Next step we will test and then build and deploy the application.
